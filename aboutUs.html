                <p>You will be placing your child in a safe and comfortable environment, designed to stimulate, nurture
                    and teach children at all levels of development. Our policy of full and open communications is
                    derived from many years of training and experience in providing support to child and parents alike.
                    Please feel free to ask for a tour of our facility anytime, so you can learn more about us. We work
                    on the premise of "owning ones own
                    behavior" and make every effort to address any concerns.
                </p>
                <p> Activities are updated and maintained. We continually replace, rearrange and assess for further
                    learning possibilities. By understanding the development and cognitive
                    capacities of each child, we match learning to abilities. Teachers guide children, allowing them to
                    problem solve, thus increasing their sense of effectiveness and comprehension.</p>

                            choose their own activities from well-defined activity centre's. Teachers interact with
                            children,
                            providing guidance and encouraging them to problem solve, promoting learning.
