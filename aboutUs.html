                <h3 id="title1">The Environment</h3>
                <p>We strive to provide a clean, safe and educational environment for young children and their families.
                    Within our care, children develop skills that promote physical, emotional, social and intellectual
                    growth. We believe in being supportive of our parents and we welcome their positive involvement and
                    presence at all times. We further believe that within our environment, children can thrive and have
                    the
                    opportunity to blossom into responsible and contributing members of our society.</p>
                <h3 id="title1">Our Staff</h3>
                <p>We require on-going training for our staff through state classes, orientation videos, in-house
                    training, and other certified professionals in the education field. All of our staff is trained in
                    First Aid and CPR.
                </p>

                <h3 id="title1">Our Philosophy</h3>
                <p>We are dedicated and committed to our children by providing exceptional education and quality child
                    care. It is our philosophy to focus on the needs of the individual child by providing a stimulating
                    atmosphere for learning along with a secure loving environment. It is our belief that a childcare
                    facility should be an extension of each child's family. Our teachers and parents are encouraged to
                    work together to provide the love and support needed as your child reaches developmental milestones
                    and his/her own personal achievements! We are passionate about education and providing our children
                    with the tools to be successful in life.</p>
