                    Welcome to Arbor Learning Center, a Homeschool Preschool.</h1>
                <p id="content">We are delighted that you are interested in learning about our school.

                    field trips, daycare changes, upcoming events, etc. We encourage families to discuss any and all
                    concerns they may have regarding any aspects of our
                    program. It is important that we, the staff, know all of our families' needs and requests. Your
                    opinions and comments are valuable to our program.

                <h1 id="title1">Infants</h1>
                <p>The period of birth to age 2 is a time of extraordinary growth and development. Healthy development
                    during these first years lays the foundation for future growth and learning in all
                    domains—cognitive, language, physical, social, emotional, and adaptive. This development occurs in a
                    complex interaction between inherited factors and the environments infants and toddlers experience
                    at home and in other settings.</p>
                <h1 id="title1">Toddlers</h1>
                <p>Children at this age are terrific learners. Two's are highly active and interested in objects and
                    people. They're undergoing rapid development in many areas, and eager for attention to help them
                    learn and understand basic things about how the world works This can be an exciting time for your
                    toddler. He/she will experience huge intellectual, social, and emotional changes that will help him
                    to explore his new world, and make sense of it. Listening to stories, singing songs, playing games
                    and doing art projects help develop language and vocabulary skills, as well as movement and sensory
                    motor skills.</p>
                <h1 id="title1">Preschoolers</h1>
                <p> At this age your child is becoming more independent and you can expect him to dress himself and
                    button clothes, brush his teeth with help, stack 9-10 blocks, draw circles and squares, use
                    scissors, walk up steps by alternating his feet, jump from a step, hop, walk on his toes, pedal a
                    tricycle, play with imaginary friends, have a very large vocabulary and use 3-4 word sentences and
                    his speech should be 3/4 understandable. Other developmental milestones include beginning to ask
                    ‘why' questions, telling stories, remembering nursery rhymes, appreciating special events, and
                    understanding daily routines. At this stage, a three year old begins to play cooperatively with
                    other children in small groups, he/she shares his toys and develop friendships. They are improving
                    coordination, beginning to combine ideas and learning more complex games, all while learning about
                    themselves and each other.</p>
