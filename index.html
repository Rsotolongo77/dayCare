                    Welcome to Arbor Learning Center, a Homeschool Preschool.</h1>
                <p id="content">We are delighted that you are interested in learning about our school.
                    Your Center Director, Teachers and staff are absolutely committed to the safety, health and
                    well-being of your child. Your concerns, your involvement, and your ideas are essential to a

                    <br></br>
                    We at Arbor Learning Center, think of ourselves primarily as a learning and educational center.
                    Our
                    programs and facilities are designed to promote the development of the child's physical,
                    intellectual, social and emotional needs. Arbor Learning Center will provide your child with an
                    age-appropriate program for such development.
                    <br></br>
                    Arbor Learning Center encourages parent involvement. We have an open-door policy, so feel free
                    to
                    come by and observe or interact with your child at anytime.
                    Newsletters will be sent out monthly, or as necessary to keep you informed on our monthly
                    themes,
                    field trips, daycare changes, upcoming events, etc. We encourage families to discuss any and all
                    concerns they may have regarding any aspects of our
                    program. It is important that we, the staff, know all of our families' needs and requests. Your
                    opinions and comments are valuable to our program.

                <h1 id="title1">Toddlers</h1>
                <p id="content">Children at this age are terrific learners. Two's are highly active and interested in
                    objects and
                    people. They're undergoing rapid development in many areas, and eager for attention to help them
                    learn and understand basic things about how the world works This can be an exciting time for
                    your
                    toddler. He/she will experience huge intellectual, social, and emotional changes that will help
                    him
                    to explore his new world, and make sense of it. Listening to stories, singing songs, playing
                    games
                    and doing art projects help develop language and vocabulary skills, as well as movement and
                    sensory
                    motor skills.</p>
                <h1 id="title1">Preschoolers</h1>
                <p id="content"> At this age your child is becoming more independent and you can expect him to dress
                    himself and
                    button clothes, brush his teeth with help, stack 9-10 blocks, draw circles and squares, use
                    scissors, walk up steps by alternating his feet, jump from a step, hop, walk on his toes, pedal
                    a
                    tricycle, play with imaginary friends, have a very large vocabulary and use 3-4 word sentences
                    and
                    his speech should be 3/4 understandable. Other developmental milestones include beginning to ask
                    ‘why' questions, telling stories, remembering nursery rhymes, appreciating special events, and
                    understanding daily routines. At this stage, a three year old begins to play cooperatively with
                    other children in small groups, he/she shares his toys and develop friendships. They are
                    improving
                    coordination, beginning to combine ideas and learning more complex games, all while learning
                    about
                    themselves and each other.</p>
